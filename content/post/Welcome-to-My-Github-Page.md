I've been more active than I expected on github. Specially using Gists as sort of tidbits documentation for stuff I might forget or want to share.

Today I was looking for some info on the web and found myself on a page with a github.io domain name. Probably not for the first time, but this time it picked my interest. I scrolled down and saw a footnote: **Powered by Hugo**. 

After a quick look at HUGO it was clearly a really straigforward way to make a blog and maybe I could use it for Documentation Sites on a later date. 

So here we are. I'll be posting here whenever I add something meaningful to my Github Repository. Some of my recent gists will also be featured here as soon as this week. And I'll be doing a quick overview of some of this account repostoried.

Hopefully this will be a usefull hub for sharing info others might find useful.
